# Gene expression cartography

{% include figure.html img="Cell puzzle illustration (red) - Lior Friedman.jpg" alt="novosparc" caption="Illustration by Lior Friedman" width="35%" %}

We introduce novoSpaRc, a computational tool that maps gene expression in space from scRNA-seq data. After presenting the theoretical framework and a primary tutorial, we continue with hands-on practical examples on whole-kidney and Drosophila embryo datasets. Only basic familiarity with programming is required (Python is desirable, but R users are welcome to join).
